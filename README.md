# IntroBioLab_Ecology
Jupyter notebook and data for BIOL221
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and example data that were used in Fall 2017 BIOL221 Intro Biology Lab.
Week 2 material includes the Jupyter notebook with all code cells executed (Week 2 notebook vf.ipynb), the completed data in Excel (Leaf_data_example_set1.xlsx), and the worksheet students completed (Week 2 worksheet.docx).
Week 6 material includes the Jupyter notebook (Week 6 notebook for students.ipynb), associated data in Excel (Ecology_hypo.xlsx), the worksheet for ecology data collection both in the field (Week 4 Forest Data Field Worksheet.docx) and in the lab (Week 5 Datasheet.docx).

Clicking on the notebook file while in GitHub will render the notebook in html format. To render the notebook to be interactive, go to https://nbviewer.juypter.org and copy the URL generated by clicking on the .ipynb file in GitHub.

Alternatively, you can download and install Anaconda (www.anaconda.com/downoload/) and run the Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator. You will need to download the Notebook file as well as the Excel spreadsheet containing the data in order for the Notebook to function.
